we have four inputs a1,a2,b1,b2 where X and  Y are defined as 
X=a1*a2
Y=b1*b2

We have to find whether i) X>Y
                       ii) X<Y
                      iii) X=Y

for all possible conditions GIVEN THAT NO MULTIPLIATION OR DIVISION OPERATIONS ARE TO BE PERFORMED TO EVALUATE THE FINAL RESULT!

The difficult cases are when
No.s are on the edge like 
If X= a1*a2
Y=b1*b2 

Difficult to know which will be greater if 
a1>b2> b1> a2 
Or similarÂ conditions
